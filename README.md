# Graph_Theory_Project

Kruskal's Algorithm implementation for both connected and disconnected graphs in Python, with visualization using Matplotlib and Tkinter.

#Introduction:

Kruskal's Algorithm is used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. In this implementation, we extend the algorithm to handle both connected and disconnected graphs. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter and visualizes the graphs and their spanning trees using Matplotlib.

#Functions Implemented:

#1. Define Number of Vertices:

Allows the user to input the number of vertices in the graph.

#2. Add Edge with Specified Weight:

Lets the user add an edge between two vertices with a specified weight.

#3. Remove Edge:

Allows the user to remove an existing edge from the graph.

#4. Calculate Minimum Spanning Tree/Forest:

Computes the Minimum Spanning Tree (or Forest) of the input graph.

#5. Clear Graph:

Clears the current graph to create a new one.

#6. Quit:

Closes the application window.

#7. Draw Standard Graphs (Minimum Spanning Tree):

Visualizes the standard graph along with its Minimum Spanning Tree.

#8. Maximum Spanning Tree:

Calculates the Maximum Spanning Tree of the graph.

#9. Draw Standard Graphs (Maximum Spanning Tree):

Visualizes the standard graph along with its Maximum Spanning Tree.

#Implementation Details:

#Graph Class:

Represents the graph and stores edges and vertices.

#Kruskal's Algorithm:

Implements the Kruskal's Algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree/Forest.

#Tkinter GUI:

Provides a user-friendly interface for adding edges, calculating MST, drawing graphs, etc.

#Matplotlib Visualization:

Uses Matplotlib to visualize the graphs and their spanning trees.

#How to Use:

Run the program.

#Input the number of vertices.

Add edges with weights, remove edges, calculate Minimum Spanning Tree, draw graphs, and find Maximum Spanning Tree as needed.

#The GUI allows interactive graph manipulation and visualization.


This implementation enhances the basic Kruskal's Algorithm by adding a user interface and the ability to handle both connected and disconnected graphs. It provides a visual representation of the graphs and their spanning trees, making it easier to understand and analyze the algorithm's behavior.
